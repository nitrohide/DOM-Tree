# DOM-Tree
Input HTML files and it will prompt the user to perform a variety of actions like printing the tree, manipulating tags, and returning the HTML represented by the DOM Tree.

Majority of the methods are done recursively due to the repetitiveness of the tags which allowed the program to iterate through each tree more efficiently. I implemented the methods within Tree.java class.
